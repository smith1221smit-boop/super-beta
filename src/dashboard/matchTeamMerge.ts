// Pure, JSX-free data-transformation functions used by
// PublicThemeRenderer.tsx's socket handlers. Extracted into their own module
// (no React, no other imports) so they can be required and exercised
// directly by a plain Node script — see scripts/verify-client-merge.js —
// the same way the backend's utils/matchTeamDiff.js is unit-verified by
// scripts/verify-team-delta.js / verify-player-delta.js.

// Proto field names can't start with `_` (grammar requires a leading
// letter), so the wire calls the Mongoose subdoc id `docId` — remap back to
// `_id` (and, for teams, keep `teamId` as its own separate field) so
// protobuf-decoded objects are byte-for-byte shape-compatible with what
// msgpack/JSON already deliver. See overlay.proto's comments on Player.docId
// / Team.docId for why these are two distinct Mongo ObjectIds, not one.

// Shared by PublicThemeRenderer.tsx's processLiveMatchUpdate/
// handleOverallDataUpdate. Both events carry a TEAM-LEVEL delta (only teams
// that changed since the backend's last tick), and — as of the backend's
// player-level delta (matchTeamDiff.js's computeChangedPlayers) — a changed
// team's OWN `players` array is now itself only the players that changed,
// not its whole roster. So this merges at both levels: a team present in
// `incoming` gets its scalar fields replaced wholesale (the backend always
// sends those in full for an included team) but its `players` merged by id
// onto the previous roster, so a player omitted from this tick keeps its
// last-known stats instead of disappearing/blanking out. A team entirely
// absent from `incoming` is untouched, same as before.
