  /**
   * Returns the shared socket, creating it only the very first time it's
   * needed. Safe to call from as many components as you like — they all
   * share the same underlying connection.
   *
   * IMPORTANT FIX: the previous version re-created the socket whenever
   * `this.socket.disconnected` was true. But a freshly-created socket.io
   * client is `disconnected === true` for the brief async gap between
   * `io(...)` being called and the `'connect'` event actually firing. Any
   * component calling `connect()` during that gap (e.g. two components
   * mounting close together, or React StrictMode double-invoking effects
   * in dev) would see `disconnected === true` and spin up a SECOND socket,
   * silently orphaning the first — each orphan still finishes connecting
   * on its own, leaking a real connection to the server. That's why you'd
   * see "Creating new socket connection" / "Socket connected" logged
   * multiple times for what should be a single shared connection.
   *
   * Fix: only create a socket if one has never been created (`this.socket
   * === null`). Once it exists, `reconnection: true` (already configured
   * below) is responsible for bringing it back after any drop — we no
   * longer tear down and replace it just because it's momentarily
   * disconnected.
   *
   * There is still no "connection count" here — components must NOT call
   * disconnect() when they unmount (see disconnect() below). This
   * connection is meant to live for the lifetime of the browser tab.
   *
   * BANDWIDTH: each overlay view is opened as its own browser tab/OBS
   * source (see DisplayHud.tsx's window.open calls), so "one socket per
   * tab" used to mean one full connection PER OPEN OVERLAY, all watching
   * the same rooms. connect() now tries to share a single real connection
   * across every same-origin tab in one browser profile via a SharedWorker
   * (sharedSocketWorker.ts) first, and only falls back to a local per-tab
   * `io()` connection — today's exact prior behavior — if SharedWorker
   * isn't available or fails to construct. Never a regression either way;
   * see the project plan for why sharing isn't guaranteed everywhere
   * (regular tabs: yes: separate OBS Browser Source docks: unverified).
